HEY THERE! this is my first attempt in Unity. It is a basic platform game. This game is a simple game experiment that aims to earn points by collecting certain diamonds and achieving results by overcoming obstacles. When you get stuck on obstacles or fall down, your lives decrease one by one and if you run out of lives, the game ends. I will be sharing screenshots of the game below.I hope you like it and please give me feedback.ACE GAME is in development
